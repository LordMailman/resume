  Experienced engineer looking to further develop skills in software
  development, deployment, and operations. You can view the repository for this
  resume on GitHub
  ([github.com/LordMailman/resume](https://github.com/LordMailman/resume)).

  I love learning new technologies; I have a very broad set of skills, ranging
  from **software development** to **hardware/firmware experience**, and from
  **Linux administration** to **cloud deployment**. Certified **Agile Scrum
  Master**. Expert **MATLAB** developer.

  In my spare time, I love hiking in beautiful New England, foraging mushrooms,
  and running tabletop roleplaying games in virtual and local communities around
  the greater Worcester area.

          Designed and implemented a container-based pipeline hosted on **AWS
          EC2** to automatically test, package, and deploy a number of
          **MATLAB** toolboxes. Originally written in **GitLab CI** for
          repositories on GitLab, and rewritten to run on **Jenkins** when the
          repositories were migrated to GitHub Enterprise. Jobs were also
          written to run static code analysis, to build and deploy **Docker**
          containers to **AWS ECR**, and to build and deploy **Jekyll** sites to
          host toolbox documentation behind an **NGINX** reverse proxy.
